            <p>
              In the 1940s, there was a man who, at the age of 65, was living off of $99 social security checks in a small house, driving a beat-up car. 
              <br>He decided it was time to make a change, so he thought about what he had to offer that other people may benefit from. 
              <br>His mind went to his fried chicken recipe, which his friends and family loved.

            <!-- <h1>Front 2</h1> -->
            <p>
              He left his home state of Kentucky and traveled throughout the country, trying to sell his recipe to restaurants. 
              <br>He even offered the recipe for free, asking for only a small chunk of the money that was earned. 
              <br>However, most of the restaurants declined his offer. 
              <br>In fact, 1,009 restaurants said no.

            <!-- <h3>Back 2</h3> -->
            <p>
              But even after all of the rejections, he persisted. He believed in himself and his chicken recipe. 
              <br>When he visited restaurant #1,010, he got a YES. 
              <br>His name? Colonel Hartland Sanders.

            <p>
              There are a few lessons that you can take away from this story. 
              <br>First, it’s never too late in life to find success. 
              <br>In a society that often celebrates young, successful people, it’s easy to start to think you’re never going to be successful after a certain age. 
              <br>However, Colonel Sanders is an example that proves that argument wrong. This story also demonstrates the power of persistence. 
              <br>You have to have confidence in yourself and believe in your work for other people to believe it also. 
              <br>Disregard anyone who tells you “no” and simply move on.
